// MARK: - Start Child Coordinator
extension Coordinating {
    /// Starts a new temporary flow with a new Coordinator.
    ///
    /// "Temporary" meaning that it's expected that the new coordinator (the "child")
    /// is expected to finish and when it finishes the calling coordinator (the "parent")
    /// will remove it from its `childCoordinator` collection.
    ///
    /// The child coordinator initialized by the parent call-site, in the `makeCoordinator` closure.
    /// This function initializes a new `UINavigationController` that is passed into the
    /// by the `makeCoordinator` closure as an argument.
    ///
    /// Optionally the parent can pass a `didStart` closure which will be invoked with the child
    /// coordinator has finished presenting its first ViewController.
    ///
    /// The `navigationHandler` closure is mandatory and should contain navigation logic where the
    /// parent handles each `NavigationStep` emitted by the child. Said `NavigationStep` is the first
    /// argument of the `navigationHandler` closure, the second argument being a closure the parent
    /// **should** call when it finishes this temporary flow. It is this call that removes the child
    /// coordinator from the parents `childCoordinator` array and also dismisses navigation stack.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - makeCoordinator: **Required** closure in which you should initialize the new child coordinator using the
    ///       `UINavigationController` being created by this function, passed as an argument in the closure.
    ///   - newNavController: The new `UINavigationController` created by this function, used when creating the child Coordinator.
    ///   - didStart: Optional Closure in which you can pass logic to be executed when the new child coordinator
    ///       has finished presentation of its root ViewController. In most cases this is not needed.
    ///   - navigationHandler: **Required** closure in which you should handle all navigation steps emitted by the
    ///       new child coordinator. This closure has two arguments:
    ///   - step: The navigation step emitted by this new child coordinator. Handled by `navigationHandler` in this parent coordinator.
    ///   - dismiss: Closure you **should** call when you want to end this temporary flow, which dismisses the navigation
    ///           stack and removes the child coordinator from its parent (the coordinator instance you called this method on).
